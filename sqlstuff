Q2 [20 points]
Find all successful coaches who have won at least one medal. List them in descending order by medal number, then by name alphabetically.

File: q2_successful_coaches

Details: A medal is credited to a coach if it shares the same country and discipline with the coach, regardless of the gender or event. Consider to use winner_code of one medal to decide its country.

Your output should look like this:
COACH_NAME|MEDAL_NUMBER
Your first row should look like this:

BRECKENRIDGE Grant|9
--------------------------------------

SELECT ch.name AS COACH_NAME,COUNT(*) AS MEDAL_NUMBER
FROM medals m
JOIN athletes a ON m.winner_code = a.code
JOIN coaches ch 
ON a.country_code = ch.country_code
AND m.discipline = ch.discipline
GROUP BY ch.name
ORDER BY MEDAL_NUMBER DESC, COACH_NAME ASC;

Q3 [20 points]
Find all athletes in Judo discipline, and also list the number of medals they have won. Sort output in descending order by medal number first, then by name alphabetically.

File: q3_Judo_athlete_medals

Details: The medals counted do not have to be from the Judo discipline, and also be sure to include any medals won as part of a team. If an athlete doesn't appear in the athletes table, please ignore him/her. Assume that if a team participates in a competition, all team members are competing.
ps: my answer is giving all athletes who won medal from Judo disciplines.
-------------------------------------------
SELECT a.name AS ATHLETE_NAME,
       COUNT(*) AS MEDAL_NUMBER
FROM athletes a
JOIN medals m ON a.code = m.winner_code
WHERE a.disciplines LIKE  '%Judo%'
GROUP BY a.name
ORDER BY MEDAL_NUMBER DESC, ATHLETE_NAME ASC;
